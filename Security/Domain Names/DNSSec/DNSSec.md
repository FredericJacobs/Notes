## Notes on DNSSec 

August 2014 - DNSSec signing patterns are worrying. Most signing schemes involve RSA-1024 that is known to be broken in less than a year with a machine that would cost less than 10^9 dollars. Breaking an intermediate signing key would allow an attacker to spoof DNS records of ANY of the websites under that signing authority.
